### Curated and Uncurated Datasets

* UnCurated datasets are the ones that are uploaded directly on the platform by the data contributors
	* Data Quality Indicators - See [here](https://centre.humdata.org/wp-content/uploads/HDX_Quality_Assurance_Framework_Draft.pdf). In this approach, users  assess the quality of the datasets through certain metadata indicators such as:
		* Source: This item captures the information related to where the data was gathered from? Who is the data owner? Who is the person that knows more about this data?
		* Reference date: This item captures the information related to when the data was collected or about the date the data refers to.Contributor: This item collects the information about who is contributing with this data into HDX. 
		* Caveats/Defects: This item provides the room to describe potential known defects on the data 
		* Methodology: This item is intended to provide how data was gathered. It will be presented initially as select all that applies:
			* Censusdata
			* Sample survey data
			* Registry data
			* Othertype, specify -  Other methodologies used to obtain the data. 
* Certain datasets might be curated for analysis (Which ones ? How to determine such datasets for curation, think: dataset importance for the community), like NCRB. These will be moderated, by CDL initially, for data quality and timeliness
	* Data summary reports
	* Data versions
	* Data validations
* Validation outside JusticeHub ? - As a support tool
	* A toolkit for users to determine the quality of the datasets, and then upload on the platform (This might create friction for certain users, and most contributors would like to have a direct access to the hub.)

### Dealing with sensitive datasets (Statiscal Disclosure Control - SDC)

* Categorsing datasets
	* No sensitive information
	* Moderately sensitive - Only add metadata
	* Most sensitive - Don't upload
* Data Anonymisation
* Resources
	* [Practice Guide](https://sdcpractice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
	* [Introduction to Statistical Disclosure Control](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/vignettes/sdc_guidelines.pdf)
